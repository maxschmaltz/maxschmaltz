### Fun Factsüòé

* I've been living on my own from the age of 15
* I gave up Lomonosov MSU to leave for Germany in 2022
* My best friend and I have found a startup, we're planning to launch till the end of 2023
* In 2019, I became a prize-winner of All-Russian Olympiade for Russian Language (basically, Linguistics), while I had only 5 month to prepare
* The prize gave me a right to enter any university of my choice in Russia for major Linguistics without any exams at all
* I completed a musical education, now I compose songs from time to time
* I got my first driving license when I was 17: that one was for motorcycles with 125cc and smaller engines
* At 18, came back to the same driving school to obtain further licenses: for autos and for large displacement motorcycles; the funny part is, I drove to the exam place on my moto to take an exam for driving motos
* I learned to weld in 3 days just for fun and crafted a food stand for my dog
